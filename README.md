# cutoff
A predictive analytics framework designed to help operations teams anticipate the risk of missing critical process deadlines. By analyzing daily workload metrics—such as transaction volume and manual edits. Uses logistic regression and other modeling techniques to estimate the likelihood of delay and surface operational drivers.

# Features
- Predicts risk of missing a defined process cutoff time (e.g., daily deadlines)
- Incorporates transaction volume, edit volume, and seasonality trends
- Supports feature engineering for temporal patterns and workload dynamics
- Easily extensible to include staffing levels, edit types, or system performance metrics
- Built for interpretability and operational insight, not just prediction

# Use Cases
- Operations management
- Workflow risk monitoring
- SLA compliance forecasting
- Volume-based staffing decisions

# Contents
- `data_simulation.R` – Generates synthetic sample data for testing
- `feature_engineering.R` – Adds seasonality, lag, and dynamic predictors
- `modeling.R` – Fits and evaluates a logistic regression model
- `README.md` – Project overview

# Requirements
- R (≥ 4.0)
- `tidyverse`
- `lubridate`
- `broom`
- `caret` (for evaluation)
- `pROC` or `yardstick` (for ROC/AUC and threshold tuning)

# Next Steps
- Add additional predictors (e.g., staffing levels, edit type complexity)
- Integrate real operational data
- Extend to other modeling approaches (e.g., decision trees, XGBoost)
- Build a dashboard or alerting interface
